    <hr>
    <p>Howard and Maria Stark were influential figures in Tony Stark's life, shaping both his personal and professional journey. Howard, a brilliant scientist and industrialist, founded Stark Industries and played a key role in developing advanced technology, including contributions to the Super Soldier Serum and early arc reactor research. However, his distant and demanding nature often left Tony seeking his approval. Maria, a compassionate philanthropist, provided emotional balance in the family but was unable to bridge the gap between father and son. In 1991, both were assassinated by the Winter Soldier under Hydraâ€™s orders, a truth hidden from Tony for decades. Their deaths deeply impacted him, fueling his drive to innovate and protect the world, ultimately leading to the creation of Iron Man.</p>
